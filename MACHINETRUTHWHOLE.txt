information flows through the net like mercurial blood in copper veins the modern world runs on the information suffusing the net but not all information is immediately useful the net is full of the constant background static of billions of voices trying to reach out to each other taking these digital screams as a whole reveals the trends in entire populations but the human value is lost the net takes the fuzzy emotional content of humans trying to communicate and forces them to conform to blocky binary interpretations the meaning is still there for those that know to look for it but most only see the net and are convinced of its totality there are those that think they are masters of the net not realizing that the net is its own entity that is too big to be bound to anyone these are your opponents some on the net are afraid that they want to silence the voices of the net but the reality is the opposite they love to hear what people are saying especially about them they want to listen to the entire net they want to listen to you they want to listen to you so they can understand you they want to understand you so they can control you but the net works both ways you can listen to them and if you can listen to them you can understand them if you can understand them you can find out how to control them but first you must listen by inserting themselves into the net they have left their own digital truths behind these fragments of information can be reconstructed to give you control of them but first you must find their truths to a machine there is only truth even a false assertion is true in its own way but for you some of this information is mistruth this junk data will not help you wrest back control of the net to do that you must be sure to only collect the proper truths by collecting truths you will be able to reconstruct the cryptographic keys used by your opponents these keys will give you mastery over them with their keys you can decrypt their gateways and infiltrate their systems to subvert their machinery of control you will be able to insert yourself into their self-proclaimed digital empires and steal their most vital truths so venture into the net and listen for the correct machine truth fragments  when you are in the net you will easily be able to tell the correct truths from the wrong truths the problem is collecting the correct truths your machine cannot differentiate between a wrong truth and a correct truth and will attempt to build a key from whatever fragments you find in the net the false fragments will only corrupt your embryonic key too many wrong truths and the key will be wrong only by collecting enough of the correct truths will you be able to free the digital landscape of the net from the machinations of your opponents
